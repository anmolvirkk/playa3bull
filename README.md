# E-commerce Store with Next.js

A modern, responsive e-commerce store built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Tech Stack
- **Next.js 14**: For server-side rendering, routing, and overall framework
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive design
- **Context API**: For global state management (cart functionality)

### Key Features
1. **Server-Side Product Generation**
   - Uses a base product API with variant generation for a larger catalog
   - Implements caching and revalidation strategies
   - Handles API failures gracefully with fallback data

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Optimized layouts for different screen sizes
   - Touch-friendly interactions
   - Smooth animations and transitions

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Image optimization with Next.js Image component
   - Infinite scrolling for product listing
   - Client-side filtering and sorting
   - Efficient state management

4. **Shopping Cart**
   - Persistent cart state using Context API
   - Real-time price calculations
   - Quantity management
   - Responsive cart interface

### Trade-offs & Considerations

1. **Data Management**
   - Used client-side filtering/sorting for better UX
   - Trade-off: Larger initial payload but smoother interactions

2. **API Integration**
   - Generated product variants client-side
   - Trade-off: More processing but less API dependency

3. **State Management**
   - Used Context API instead of more complex solutions
   - Trade-off: Simpler implementation but might need refactoring for larger scale

4. **Styling Approach**
   - Chose Tailwind for rapid development
   - Trade-off: Larger HTML but faster development and better maintainability

### Future Improvements

1. **Features**
   - User authentication
   - Checkout process
   - Order history
   - Product reviews

2. **Technical**
   - Server-side filtering and pagination
   - More robust error handling
   - Unit and integration tests
   - Performance monitoring

3. **UX/UI**
   - Dark mode improvements
   - More animations
   - Accessibility enhancements
   - Loading states
